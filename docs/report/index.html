            <h3 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h3>
            <p>Traditional agriculture is facing many challenges in order to adapt to the growing scale of farming. For
                example, when the size of planting is huge, it is impractical for farmers to know the specific detail of
                each part of their land; therefore, it is difficult to improve the precision of farming. With big data
                and Internet of Things (IoT) device, it becomes possible for farmers to know the condition precisely,
                and fertilize the lands according to their condition. With technologies like GPS and sensors, farmers
                are able to monitor the temperature, light, humidity condition at all times; thus reduce labor and cost.
                In this paper, we proposed a smart farming system that can benefit farmers to monitor the environment,
                and make predictions about the pest, output. By utilizing the power of data science, various machine
                learning algorithms can be applied to smart agriculture, and improve the overall efficiency of
                farming.</p>
            <h3 id="overview-of-bigagriculture">Overview of BigAgriculture</h3>
            <p>To give a brief overview of our BigAgriculture system, we first need to define what is smart farming, and
                then argue how our BigAgriculture system facilitate its operation. According the description in <em>Scientific
                    development of smart farming technologies and their application in Brazil</em> (D. Pivoto), smart
                farming is based on the incorporation of information and communication technologies into machinery,
                equipment, and sensors in agricultural production systems. It allows a large volume of data and
                information to be generated with progressive insertion of automation into the process. To better serve
                smart farming, we proposed BigAgriculture, an aggregated system for smart farming. BigAgriculture allows
                farmers to conveniently get access to environmental information of their land, and give prediction about
                the output of their farm, the severity of pest, etc. using machine learning algorithms. In addition, we
                also provides visualization of these results, which gives farmers an intuitive understanding about how
                the situation is. There are a few major components of BigAgriculture:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sensor</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sensor is an important link in IoT infrastructure, where it can detect various factors of environments
                nearby, such as temperature, light, humidity. It can also detect the chemical materials in soils. By
                connecting to LAN of WAN, sensors are able to send data to a central server, which is often on the
                cloud.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Software</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Software is used to collect informations provided by sensors, and do the analysis as well as
                visualization. For BigAgriculture system, we decide to use open source programs. For big data
                application, we use Apache Hadoop as our distributed system to store data sent by sensors. Since the
                amount of data is significantly large, it is impractical to store all the on a single device, and this
                is why we want to use distributed system. For data analysis, we use Tensorflow to do the prediction,
                which is a very popular deep learning framework that enable us to implement various machine learning
                algorithms. As for visualization, we use Python&rsquo;s matplotlib and seaborn library.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Connectivity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To allow our sensors to send data to our cloud servers, we decide to use LoRa as our communication
                network. The reason why we are using LoRa is because it can cover range of a few kilometers, which is
                greater than cellular network. It is also designed for devices that require low power and low cost. In
                BigAgriculture system, we would like to provide convenience to farmers as much as possible, and we do
                not want them to replace battery of our IoT sensors frequently. Therefore, LoRa becomes our first choice
                for communication network. In addition, considering the farm often being a very large area, the
                advantage that LoRa is able to transmit data over a wide area also benefits a lot to our BigAgriculture
                system.</p>
            <h3 id="optimization-problem-for-data-transmission">Optimization Problem for Data Transmission</h3>
            <p>The main problem for data transmission is that each sensor transmit its data to the central server using
                LoRa, whereas a sensor standing right next to the central server can easily overwhelm another sensor far
                away at the edge of the cell. This is called Near Far Problem. To solve this problem, we use Linear
                Programming to solve this problem.</p>
            <p>We define</p>
            <p>$$SIR_i=\frac{G_{ii}p_i}{\sum_{i\ne j}G_{ij}p_j+n_i}$$</p>
            <p>Where G is the channel gain, and p is the power.</p>
            <p>Our objective is to minimize the overall power usage, while ensure signal intensity received for each
                sensor is above its minimum threshold:</p>
            <p>$$ min \sum_i p_i $$</p>
            <p>$$ subject\ to\ SIR_i(p) \ge \gamma_i, \forall\ i $$</p>
            <p>This is a linear programming problem, and we can solve it with optimization algorithms.</p>
            <h3 id="big-data-infrastructure-for-bigagriculture">Big Data Infrastructure for BigAgriculture</h3>
            <p>To better manipulate huge data collected by sensors, we need a realible distributed system to store these
                data and do the computation. Apache Hadoop is a very popular distributed system framework, and provides
                many useful components, such as HDFS, MapReduce and HBase.</p>
            <p>The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is part of the Apache Hadoop Core project. It is a distributed
                file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It has many similarities with existing distributed
                file systems. However, the differences from other distributed file systems are significant. HDFS is
                highly fault-tolerant and is designed to be deployed on low-cost hardware. HDFS provides high throughput
                access to application data and is suitable for applications that have large data sets. HDFS relaxes a
                few POSIX requirements to enable streaming access to file system data.</p>
            <p>Hadoop MapReduce is a software framework for easily writing applications which process vast amounts of
                data (multi-terabyte data-sets) in-parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware
                in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner.</p>
            <p>Apache HBase is used when you need random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data. This project&rsquo;s
                goal is the hosting of very large tables &ndash; billions of rows with millions of columns &ndash; atop
                clusters of commodity hardware. Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational
                database modeled after Google&rsquo;s Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data by
                Chang et al. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System,
                Apache HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop and HDFS.</p>
            <p>In our BigAgriculture system, Apache Hadoop servers as the overall big data infrastructure. We use HDFS
                to store huge agriculture data, and use Hadoop MapReduce to aggregate all the data for computation. If
                we need to query data in realtime, we can use HBase to provide database service. By combining these
                tools, we can achieve a basic cloud service for big agriculture data, and thus facilitate data analysis
                and visualization.</p>
            <h3 id="regression-problem-for-prediction">Regression Problem for Prediction</h3>
            <p>As central server receive environmental information, and then we can use this information to infer the
                output of the land, and whether it suffers from pests.</p>
            <p>Take the example of making prediction of the output, we will use Linear Regression algorithm. Suppose
                data such as temperature, light, humidity are labeled as the independent variables \(x_1, x_2&hellip;x_n\),
                and the output of the land is the dependent variable \(y\), we can use historical data to train our linear
                regression model, and then make prediction about the future output. To train our model, we first use
                Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to make parameter estimation. Suppose we have (m) historical data of
                independent variables \(x_{11}, x_{12}&hellip;x_{1n}\dots\ x_{m1}, x_{m2}&hellip;x_{mn}\) denoted by a
                \(m\times n\) matrix \(X\) and their corresponding dependent variables \(y_1, y_2&hellip;y_m\), denoted by a
                vector \(y\) with length of \(m\). Linear Regression model assume there exists a linear relationship between
                independent variables and dependent variables: \(y_i=w^Tx_i+\epsilon_i\), where \(\epsilon_i\) follows
                normal distribution. By MLE, we can estimate \(\hat w=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\), and then we can make
                predictions.</p>
            <p>With various machine learning algorithm, farmers can easily estimate their payoff of farming, and better
                plan for the future. It is the same for predict whether their land suffers from pests, with Logistic
                Regression instead of Linear Regression.</p>
            <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the era of big data, the importance of utilizing various advanced cloud computing tools becomes more
                and more critical. By utilizing the power of sensors, open source softwares and communication network,
                our BigAgriculture system provides one-stop service to collect, store, analyze and visualize agriculture
                data. By machine learning algorithms&rsquo;s prediction, farmers can grasp a better understanding of
                their land, without the necessity of actually visiting the field. With our BigAgriculture system, it is
                undoubted that the efficiency of smart farming will be further improved, and the cost for labor will be
                considerably reduced.</p>
