<p>Fast-forward and a lot has changed. Over the last several years, the cost to purchase computing and storage resources has decreased dramatically. Aided by virtualization, commodity servers that could be clustered and blades that could be networked in a rack changed the economics of computing. This change coincided with innovation in software automation solutions that dramatically improved the manageability of these systems.</p>
<p>The capability to leverage distributed computing and parallel processing techniques dramatically transformed the landscape and dramatically reduce latency. To implement distributed computing, we need tools like Apache Hadoop, MapReduce, and a brief introduction is given here about what are they, and how to use them to solve practical problems.</p>
<h2 id="hadoop-overview">Hadoop Overview</h2>
<p>Hadoop itself provides many useful components, such as HDFS, MapReduce and Yarn.</p>
<h3 id="hdfs">HDFS</h3>
<p>The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is part of the Apache Hadoop Core project. It is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It has many similarities with existing distributed file systems. However, the differences from other distributed file systems are significant. HDFS is highly fault-tolerant and is designed to be deployed on low-cost hardware. HDFS provides high throughput access to application data and is suitable for applications that have large data sets. HDFS relaxes a few POSIX requirements to enable streaming access to file system data.</p>
<p>HDFS has a master/slave architecture. An HDFS cluster consists of a single NameNode, a master server that manages the file system namespace and regulates access to files by clients. In addition, there are a number of DataNodes, usually one per node in the cluster, which manage storage attached to the nodes that they run on. HDFS exposes a file system namespace and allows user data to be stored in files. Internally, a file is split into one or more blocks and these blocks are stored in a set of DataNodes. The NameNode executes file system namespace operations like opening, closing, and renaming files and directories. It also determines the mapping of blocks to DataNodes. The DataNodes are responsible for serving read and write requests from the file system’s clients. The DataNodes also perform block creation, deletion, and replication upon instruction from the NameNode.</p>
<p><img src="http://example.org/p1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition to data storage, HDFS also provides a series of other functionality. For example, HDFS can make replicas of data to be stored on a block, and put its replicas on other blocks. Therefore, if the data is damaged or the node storing the data is unavailable due to some technical glitch, HDFS will retrieve its replica from blocks on other nodes, to ensure the robustness and reliability of data storage.</p>
<h3 id="mapreduce">MapReduce</h3>
<p>Hadoop MapReduce is a software framework for easily writing applications which process vast amounts of data (multi-terabyte data-sets) in-parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner.</p>
<p>A MapReduce <em>job</em> usually splits the input data-set into independent chunks which are processed by the <em>map tasks</em> in a completely parallel manner. The framework sorts the outputs of the maps, which are then input to the <em>reduce tasks</em>. Typically both the input and the output of the job are stored in a file-system. The framework takes care of scheduling tasks, monitoring them and re-executes the failed tasks.</p>
<p>Typically the compute nodes and the storage nodes are the same, that is, the MapReduce framework and the Hadoop Distributed File System are running on the same set of nodes. This configuration allows the framework to effectively schedule tasks on the nodes where data is already present, resulting in very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster.</p>
<p>The MapReduce framework consists of a single master called ResourceManager, one worker called NodeManager per cluster-node, and MRAppMaster per application.</p>
<p>Minimally, applications specify the input/output locations and supply <em>map</em> and <em>reduce</em> functions via implementations of appropriate interfaces and/or abstract-classes. These, and other job parameters, comprise the <em>job configuration</em>.</p>
<p>The Hadoop <em>job client</em> then submits the job, and configuration to the ResourceManager, which then assumes the responsibility of distributing the software/configuration to the workers, scheduling tasks and monitoring them, providing status and diagnostic information to the job-client.</p>
<p><img src="http://example.org/p8.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="yarn">Yarn</h3>
<p>The fundamental idea of YARN is to split up the functionalities of resource management and job scheduling/monitoring into separate daemons. The idea is to have a global ResourceManager (<em>RM</em>) and per-application ApplicationMaster (<em>AM</em>). An application is either a single job or a DAG of jobs.</p>
<p>The ResourceManager and the NodeManager form the data-computation framework. The ResourceManager is the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among all the applications in the system. The NodeManager is the per-machine framework agent who is responsible for containers, monitoring their resource usage (cpu, memory, disk, network) and reporting the same to the ResourceManager/Scheduler.</p>
<p>The per-application ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a framework specific library and is tasked with negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager(s) to execute and monitor the tasks.</p>
<p>The ResourceManager has two main components: Scheduler and ApplicationsManager.</p>
<p>The Scheduler is responsible for allocating resources to the various running applications subject to familiar constraints of capacities, queues etc. The Scheduler is pure scheduler in the sense that it performs no monitoring or tracking of status for the application. Also, it offers no guarantees about restarting failed tasks either due to application failure or hardware failures. The Scheduler performs its scheduling function based on the resource requirements of the applications; it does so based on the abstract notion of a resource <em>Container</em> which incorporates elements such as memory, cpu, disk, network etc.</p>
<p>The ApplicationsManager is responsible for accepting job-submissions, negotiating the first container for executing the application specific ApplicationMaster and provides the service for restarting the ApplicationMaster container on failure. The per-application ApplicationMaster has the responsibility of negotiating appropriate resource containers from the Scheduler, tracking their status and monitoring for progress.</p>
<h2 id="spark">Spark</h2>
<p>Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It is used for distributed computing, like MapReduce, and Spark can not only run on Hadoop Yarn, it can also run on Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, or standalone. Different from MapReduce, Spark utilize memory instead of hard disk, so it achieves a high performance for both batch and streaming data compared to MapReduce. Also, it offers many high-level operators that make it easy to build parallel apps, and supports multiple programming languages such as Python, Scala and R. In this report, we will perform a few experiements such as WordCount to compare the performance of MapReduce and Spark.</p>
